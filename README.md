📊 Customer Reviews Sentiment Analysis

📌 Overview

  This project analyzes customer reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.      The objective is to transform unstructured textual data into actionable insights that help businesses understand customer feedback and improve data-driven decision-making.

🎯 Business Objective

  To automatically analyze customer reviews and identify sentiment trends, enabling businesses to monitor customer satisfaction, improve products and services, and enhance overall customer experience.
